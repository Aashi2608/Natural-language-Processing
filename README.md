# 🚗🔍 NLP-Driven Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection

Welcome to the official repository for **"Employing Machine Learning Techniques for Fraud Detection in Vehicle Insurance"** – a natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning research project aimed at transforming the way insurance claims are analyzed and validated.

## 📌 Project Overview

In the high-stakes world of vehicle insurance, fraud detection is more critical than ever. This project leverages cutting-edge **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to intelligently assess and flag potentially fraudulent insurance claims.

Through this project, we explore how text-based claim descriptions, structured metadata, and behavioral insights can be harnessed using ML classifiers to enhance claims integrity.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 **Text Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF, and more.
- 🔍 **Classification Models**: Implementation of algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to detect anomalies.
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to assess model efficiency.
- 📚 **Research-Driven Approach**: Backed by academic analysis and real-world case studies.
